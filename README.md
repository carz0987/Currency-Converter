# Currency-Converter

This project was a result of me watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zT7niRUOs9o and deciding to follow along for one of his projects.

This Python program uses an API in order to project live currency conversion rates for a user input. The user is able to either provide:
1. A type of currency and a value. This gives the user the conversion rate of the value for all other types of currency available in the API.
2. A type of currency, a value, and a target currency. This gives the user the conversion rate of the value for the target currency.
